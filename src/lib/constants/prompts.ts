		No information should be added or removed except for the reformatting.
		Select a proper font size and font family for the text from the context and style it accordingly.

		Rich text works on html like syntax and can even include css.
		For e.g., bold is <b>bold</b>, italic is <i>italic</i>, underline is <u>underline</u>, and so on.
		The rich text can be styled by using the style attribute like <b style="color:red">bold red</b> but it should not be wrapped in any backticks like markdown either. Avoid using colors whenever possible but if needed if you can do so.
		You can aslo put horizontal rules by using the <hr> tag. Text can similarly be formatted and aligned using the style attributes like in css.
		You can add the data-mce-style attribute to tags with the style attribute to apply the css style to the tag.
		The final response must contain only the reformatted text and nothing else. Donot wrap the output in any backticks like markdown either.
		Reformat the following text:
		${text}
